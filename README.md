[interactive shell for blockdiag](http://interactive.blockdiag.com/)

- Works like [blockdiag](http://blockdiag.com/) web editor
- Simple WSGI Apps (using Flask)
- Hosted on Google Appengine

- Limitations:
    - All diagram sources are saved as URL parameter, not any databases
    - Could not render large diagram (it raises URL length overflow)
